        <p>Amazon Review of Echo Dot Kids Edition5/5 Stars: I don’t need to talk to my kid anymore!
        <p>The Echo Dot Kids Edition has been a LIFESAVER. I have a five-year-old daughter, and though I love her, she incredibly dumb.</p>
        <p>I always have to read books to her and help her with her kindergarten math homework. Like, can’t you read by now? It’s really annoying to have to help her all of the time, but now the Echo Dot Kids Edition does it for me! 
          Alexa can answer math problems and read her stories. Now I can spend my nights binge watching Shameless instead of doing stupid little kid homework. 
          Thank god for Alexa.</p>
