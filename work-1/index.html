        <h3> Reflection: February 12, 2020 </h3>
        <p>Working on my GitHub Pages site has been quite the experience so far. I am very surprised at how much I have been able to accomplish with the skills and concepts we have learned in class and am very happy to have gotten to this point. I had some experience with HTML and CSS before this course, as we had gone over it in one of my information science classes, but I had never really made something with the coding skills I had learned. This is the first time I have actually had the freedom to make and design something using code and I have been pretty happy with how it has been going so far. I have specifically enjoyed using HTML and creating the structure of my site and learning about design concepts, but greatly struggled with comprehending and coming up with a theme for my site. </p>
        <p> Because I had prior coding experience going into this assignment, I felt very comfortable using HTML and CSS. Sometimes being comfortable can lead to boredom, but this was not the case for me. I was still interested and engaged in the lectures and class discussions about how to use HTML and even learned many new things by watching the LinkedIn Learning videos. I have definitely had a trickier time with CSS, as it was something that was often skimmed over in classes I have taken. There are so many options with CSS that it has been hard for me to pinpoint what properties I want/need to use and how I want them to work into my web design. </p>
        <p> A thing I really, really struggled with was coming up with a thorough theme and design idea for my website. Originally, I did not follow understand the point of the assignment and thus pitched ideas for design that were already mandatory for the site, such as having a menu and a place to put my classwork. I also did not have a clue what kind of theme, or really what a theme was, when I wrote my initial design pitch. This pitch was very vague and general.  </p>
        <p> This past Monday’s lecture was incredibly helpful in getting me on the right track in creating a new and more focused theme/design and made me realize that what I had written previously was not going to be helpful to me in anyway. I wish we had done this sooner, as it still took me a few days to really flesh out a new theme and figure out a way to begin to implement this using CSS. I think my new and improved design plan – keywords: groovy, psychedelic, spunky – will help me with my website going forward. I also plan to create a thorough mockup of what I want to attempt to create and a timeline of goals so I can work as hard and smart as I can to try and get this site where I want it to be. The lecture on design principles was also very interesting to me, though since I didn’t really have a design plan together, I had trouble picking which ones could work for my site as a whole. </p>
        <p> While I did revise my design concept, I did not revise my embedded fiction writing. This is because, at this point, I do not think it needs revising. I could flesh it out a bit more, but I was more focused on revising my design concept, solidifying my HTML, and adding CSS that I did not pay too much attention to the embedded fiction. If I have more ideas for what I can do with that piece in the future, I will revise it. </p>
        <p> I am very excited to begin working with photoshop in the upcoming weeks. I have very basic photo editing skills and graphic design skills and would like see how I can implement the design principles we learned in class in this medium. I would also like to learn how to make a logo and other graphics I can use to further reflect the theme of my website. I have also noticed that Data Visualization is on the schedule. I am interested in this topic, as I am an information science major and think learning about databases and data management is really cool. I’m also interested in the reading from “A Web for Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences.” I am very passionate about accessibility, as I have a younger brother with autism and find that many spaces, including online ones, for differently abled children, teens, and adults cannot be very accommodating. </p>
