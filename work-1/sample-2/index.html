        <h2>Design Concept Writing Assignment</h2>
        <p> I plan to make my website a professional space that can exhibit my work, but also exhibit some of my personality. At the moment, I am not totally sure what this will encompass, but here are the ideas I have so far. 
          I enjoy websites that are fun but not too flashy, as well as organized and easy to navigate. I would like to show my different writing samples, such as news articles and essays. 
          As a grow my portfolio, I canadd a space for my audio, photo and tech projects. 
          I will definitely have a menu bar and a personal biography with links to my social media pages on my website. </p>
        <p> This color scheme may change as I begin to work more on the site.I really like the Cardamom and Tea website that was linked to in the instructions for this prompt. 
          I donâ€™t have a lot of content that I could put on this site at the moment, so I think a simple design with a few links in the menu bar would be good for me. I also really like the website for the now-defunct online magazine Rookie (https://www.rookiemag.com/). 
          I like the combinations on pictures and links on the site. Its organized an interesting, yet accessible way. </p>
