        <h2>Pecha Kucha</h2>
        <h3>Criteria 4: An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked</h3>
        <p>The Pecha Kucha was my least favorite assignment and the one I found most frustrating to complete. Presentations give me anxiety, and even though I did this in front of no one and in the comfort of my own home, I found it very nerve-wracking and difficult to complete. My topic was Performance vs. Preference. I struggled to find extra, more interesting and relevant information to include. In the end I was able to power through, find the information I needed, and do the narration. I think I could have done a better job with the narration, but I knew that I would likely focus on it too much and it would detract from my other assignments, so I didnâ€™t revise it too many times.</p>
        <h3>My Pecha Kucha presentation can be found on the page called "Presentation."</h2>
