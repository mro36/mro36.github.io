        <h2>Embedded Fiction Writing Assignment: Amazon Review of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Kids-designed-Rainbow/dp/B07Q2MXPH6/ref=sr_1_1?    keywords=echo+dot+kids&qid=1581715502&s=amazon-devices&sr=1-1">Echo Dot Kids Edition</a></h2>
        <h3>Criteria 1: An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audiece.</h3>
        <p>My Embedded Fiction is my strongest piece in terms of sticking with a certain genre or audience. It is a satire/humorous piece utilizing the Amazon Review format. It shows how ridiculous some review can be and poking fun at how some parents are a bit aloof and not active in their kids lives. When I was writing this embedded fiction originally, I thought of the mother in the movie adaption of Matilda and how she expects her very young daughter to take care of herself. Another place where I could write a form of embedded from a parent like this is on Facebook. I could have done a post in a “Free and For Sale” group putting their child up for adoption for a dumb reason. This is a bit dark, but I think its kind of funny. For my revision for this piece, I decided to make it more of a sequel to the original review reflecting how this parent feel about the Echo Dot Kids now that schools are closed because of the pandemic.</p>
        <h2>Revised</h2>
          <h3>5/5 Stars: Alexa is the principal of homeschool</h3>
          <p>The Echo Dot Kids Edition has still been SUCH a LIFESAVER. I originally posted my review back in January and raved about how Alexa can read to my five-year-old and help her with her homework. Now that schools are closed, this is especially helpful to me. I have a full time job and am expected to be on Zoom all day, so I really don’t have any time to do any of this “homeschool” crap these teachers expect me to do. Now, instead of just doing homework, Alexa can help with a whole curriculum! It’s actually so amazing. I just sit my daughter in a room with an iPad and her Echo Dot and she can handle everything herself. And I can still spend my free time watching Shameless. It’s a win-win situation!</p>
        <h2>Original</h2>
          <h3>5/5 Stars: I don't need to talk to my kid anymore!</h3>
          <p> The Echo Dot Kids Edition has been a LIFESAVER. I have a five-year-old daughter, and though I love her, she incredibly dumb. I always have to read books to her and help her with her kindergarten math homework.Like, can’t you read by now? It’s really annoying to have to help her all of the time, but now the Echo Dot Kids Edition does it for me! Alexa can answer math problems and read her stories. Now I can spend my nights binge watching Shameless instead of doing stupid little kid homework. Thank god for Alexa. </p>
