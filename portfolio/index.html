        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
       <p>This website encapsulates all of the major work I have done this term. I am proud of what I have accomplished and think I have come a long way since the beginning of the semester. For the first work in progress assignment, I wrote a piece of Embedded Fiction, created and revised a design concept for my GitHub pages site, and built the skeleton of my GitHub pages site using HTML and CSS. I think this was my strongest unit, as I was really interested and excelled at using HTML and working with GitHub. For the second work in progress assignment, I created and revised various designs using Photoshop. This was a more difficult unit for me, as I struggled with learning to use Photoshop and also encountered some personal situations that made it difficult for me to complete my work. The last unit of the semester focused on audio editing and using audacity. This was probably my favorite unit and the easiest for me, since I have prior experience with audio editing. </p>
       <p>While I am proud of what I have accomplished, I do see some recurring issues in my work. I think my photoshop assignments could be a bit cleaner and do not look as advanced as some of my classmates’ pieces. This is the same for my web design. I have been struggling with some personal issues while at home during the pandemic, so it was very difficult for me to do all of the changes that I wanted to do. As the semester came to a close, I realized that my vision would not be realized to its fullest potential and that I would need to find a design that I could realistically complete considering my skills, my circumstances, and time. For example, I originally wanted to incorporate more patterns and colors into my design, but ended up putting that aside because I was struggling to implement it in a way where my text was still readable. I ended up just using a solid BlueViolet background with white sans serif font to make my content readable while also conveying some of the spirit of my written design concept. I think these constraints negatively affected my work and I could have done better if the circumstances were different. Still, as I stated previously, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish.</p>
        <p>I approached the editing process for most of my pieces by seeing how I could further enhance them and then outlining clear steps as to how I could do that. Each time I took a look at what I was doing, what I didn’t like about it, and how I could go about using the skills I had at that present moment to change it. This was true for all of the assignments I ended up revising in some way. I went through a few revisions of my Expectations photoshop assignment. For this particular assignment, I decided to choose a different ad (I originally chose the guitar ad) and decided that I would zero in on one element of the ad and distort into a kind of pop art/psychedelic way. I realized this by cutting the head of a boy out of one of the add, changing the colors and then adding various filters and the liquify effect.</p>
        <p>I think an imagined audience would view my website as a class portfolio displaying the work of someone who is new to photoshop and web design. My design is very simple but has a touch of spunk to it. I think this is the same for my pieces and my writing and that the work itself accurately conveys my own personality. My site is well organized and straightforward. I believe each project is easy to find and my portfolio is organized in a way that a user can understand what I was trying to accomplish in showing and reflecting on these pieces. Its an accessible site, and I adjusted in the colors so there would be more contrast and could be easier to read. I hope that my audience will be able to understand that this site is meant to highlight my work in the class and my reflections on it as a whole.</p>
        <p>I don’t think my writing style or approach has changed much throughout the course. As a former English major and current DNID major and employee of The Pitt News, I do quite a lot of writing. I enjoyed being able to write the Embedded Fiction piece, since I don’t get many changes to write fiction. It was a lot of fun to create a character and write something from their perspective. I liked writing the reflections as well and thought they were very helpful in self-evaluating my work. I went about writing the reflections like how I would write I personal essay or journal entry, while of course sticking to the outlined criteria that is expected to be in the piece. I did not think of this course as reading or writing heavy, but this may just be because I am used to having complete larger amounts of reading and writing assignments on a weekly basis in my other classes. I still liked what we read and thought it was very helpful and educational, especially in terms of looking at design concepts and digital media. For me, this class was more about learning technical skills as opposed to improving my writing.</p>
       <p>I really enjoyed taking Composing Digital Media this semester. It was a lot of fun and I was able to learn a bunch of new skills that I can transfer into the real world. Since my summer work plans fell through due to the pandemic, I plan on working on some of my own personal projects with audio, photoshop, video editing and maybe InDesign. I’ll be spending my summer in my air-conditioned basement watching LinkedIn Learning videos! I’m grateful for the lessons I’ve learned in this class and am now thinking of taking another digital media class for my last DNID upper-level elective.</p>
