        <h2>Version 2: February 14</h2>
        <p>After completing the theme brainstorming activities in class, I have realized that my previous design pitch was very bland and not completely following the directions. Many of the points I made in that pitch still stand –such as “I enjoy websites that are fun but not too flashy, as well as organized and easy to navigate” –but I now have a more realized design concept in mind. I would like my website to have a “groovy” late 1960s to 1970s-style theme. Though I was not alive during this time, I am fascinated by media that was produced in or takes place in the ‘60s and ‘70s.</p>
          <p>I think the culture of this time period is very vibrant and spunky and portrays a kind of “can-do” attitude. I think my website can reflect these characteristics through “light and bright” colors such as orange, white, and yellow and through bold and funky –yet readable –fonts. Aesthetic inspirations of mine are That 70s Show and Austin Powers. If possible –like stated in my last pitch -I would like to find a way to incorporate more images with my site like the website for the online magazine Rookie does. These images are still to be determined, but I am leaning towards some of the psychedelic patterns that exist in the Austin Powers universe.</p>
        <h2>Version 1: January 22</h2>
        <p> I plan to make my website a professional space that can exhibit my work, but also exhibit some of my personality. At the moment, I am not totally sure what this will encompass, but here are the ideas I have so far. I enjoy websites that are fun but not too flashy, as well as organized and easy to navigate. I would like to show my different writing samples, such as news articles and essays. As a grow my portfolio, I can add a space for my audio, photo and tech projects. I will definitely have a menu bar and a personal biography with links to my social media pages on my website. </p>
          <p> I really like the Cardamom and Tea website that was linked to in the instructions for this prompt. I don’t have a lot of content that I could put on this site at the moment, so I think a simple design with a few links in the menu bar would be good for me. I also really like the website for the now-defunct online magazine Rookie. I like the combinations on pictures and links on the site. Its organized an interesting, yet accessible way. </p>
