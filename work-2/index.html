        <h2>Work-In-Progress Submission 2</h2>
        <h3> Reflection: March 30, 2020 </h3>
        <p>This Work-in-Progress submission has been quite the process. I definitely had more trouble completing this assignment than              with the last one, mainly because the photoshop unit was a difficult period for me. I was sick on and off during this unit              and struggled to complete work outside of class, and because of this, my photoshop skills did not develop as much as I would            have liked them to. However, I have learned a LOT about the program and photo editing and am proud of what I have been able              to accomplish. I just wish I would have practiced more, since photo editing is definitely not as easy for me as writing or HTML. </p>
        <p> I liked the different photoshop activities that we completed in class and seeing the examples completed on the board. My                 favorite activity was the genre remix we completed as a group. I liked it because it was nice to work with others and see               how they used photoshop and what skills they had. I also like talking about movies generally and it was nice to be able to               think of cool was to “remix” famous movies to fit the genre we were given. My group first picked horror as a genre, so we               chose “The Shining.” Then we picked documentary as the remix genre. After a bit of discussion, we were able to come up with             something we all really liked. The genre remix I submitted on my GitHub site is not the one that was made during class time.             I forget who originally submitted that assignment from my group, but I do know that it wasn’t me. I decided to make an                   iteration of what we came up with as a group to submit myself, and this is what is currently on my site. </p>
        <p>I wish we could have done some more demonstrations in class. The LinkedIn Learning videos were helpful, but I often find that            I learn better by having someone explain something to me or show something to me in person. I think maybe doing some more                guided activities in photoshop could also be helpful.</p>
        <p>Completing this work-in-progress was quite difficult because of internet problems at my apartment. I had been having a few              issues connecting throughout the week, but was still able to get all of my necessary work done. However, on Friday as I was              working on my submission our internet totally cut out and I wasn’t able to complete everything I needed to. This continued              into the weekend, but after a few phone calls to Xfinity, my roommate was able to get back online on Monday. This was a                  pretty big inconvenience, especially since all classes are reliant on internet access now. Despite this, everything ended up            working out, just a few days later than I would have liked it to.</p>
        <p>For this submission, I mainly focused on the revision and completion of my photoshop assignments. I really did not like the              expectations assignment I made initially. I revised the guitar ad but had no vision for what I wanted to do, so it came out              messy. I went back to the beginning and chose a different ad – the one with the little boy acting surprised – and started                over. Once I saw the boys face, I knew I wanted to cut that out and add some bright color to it. I ended up going with purple            and made him a little grape boy. I am proud of what I did with that piece and I think I effectively followed the directions              and did what the assignment asked. In addition to the expectations assignment, I revised my logo. I originally tried to make            something for a record store, but then started from scratch and decided to make a logo for The Hype House – a conglomerate of            Tik Tok stars that live in a house in California. I like the aesthetic of this logo and think it fits with the Hype House’s              vibe. Like I said previously, I needed to make another iteration of the genre remix assignment since I did not have what was            originally completed in class. I decided not to revise the storyboard activity because I was happy with the work I did there.</p>
        <p>Because I was so focused on photoshop revisions and had issues with my internet, I did not pay as much attention to the                  design of my website. I made sure my HTML was working and added pages for the checklist and each design sample, as well as              placed the pictures of the photoshop samples on their respective pages. This was not difficult and I had no problems creating            these pages. I made a few changes to my CSS to try and further implement my design concept. However, there’s still a lot more            I think I can do with my design. I hope to implement this in the next few weeks and have fully realized my design concept by            the time I submit my final portfolio.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to working on the audio unit. I’m very interested in audio production and would like to get into podcast            and audio journalism in the future. I am currently enrolled in Intro to Audio Storytelling and have learned a bit about                  editing in Audition. I think these skills will be transferable to Audacity. I am also very happy with how the class has been            translated into remote learning. This is probably the best transition out of all of the classes that I’m currently taking.              Thank you for being organized and setting up week by week schedules for us to reference and follow. It makes everything a                lot easier!</p>
